As I understand, We need to make a thing that reads a VIN, and returns info,

car fax does the following.

    Accident/damage records

    Last registered in

    Service records

    US History
        -skip for now, focus on canada

    Open Recals

    actively decalred stolen

    Detailed History
        - Registration Issued or Renewed

strat:
first throw vin into big function, then after that split it up, then at the end end up with big json that we send
back to website
